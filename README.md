## User Story
As a user I'd like to imagine different fight scenarios with famous people/characters and give input on who I think would win the fight. 

## Description
To create a MERN SPA Project, which is a MERN-stack single-page application that combines several technologies including MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

## Technologies Used 
* Utilized React.JS & Bulma CSS for the views and template language. 
* Utilized MongoDB to connect to the database using Apollo/GraphQL. 
* Utilized Express.JS and Node.JS for API routes.
* Utilized JWT to implement user authentication.     
* Utilized Heroku to deploy the app on a live URL.
